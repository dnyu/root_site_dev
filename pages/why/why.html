					<li> One Root can already save substantial energy with minimal effort. </li>
					<li> However, energy savings grow exponentially as the number of Roots in the same network increases. </li>
					<li> Getting a second root means the first Root is no longer limited to it's own data input, giving it more information to optimize over. </li> 
					<li> As Turing's algorithms gather more information to learn from, they'll progressively become smarter and more capable of producing cutting edge optimization metrics for your energy. </li>
