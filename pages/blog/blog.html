			Ethereum is a public, decentralized computing platform that runs smart contracts, pieces of code with arbitrary rules. Anyone in the world with access to the internet can interact and audit the information on the Ethereum network. This allows smart contracts to become autonomous agents in our technological landscape, making it a perfect candidate for potential IoT applications. Imagine an open-source family of IoT optimized devices that anyone can interact with and develop novel applications.

			Root leverages the Ethereum blockchain to stay updated with your energy needs. Using a smart contract system, you can interact with Root through any internet connection. Root constantly monitors the Ethereum blockchain to enable real-time state changes. Ethereum’s decentralized framework enables device autonomy and allows anyone to connect new Internet of Things devices with Root’s to form a family of autonomous smart devices.

			"Big Data is an enormous opportunity for making environmental improvements and harnessing energy-efficiency savings. We seem to observe an 'energy-efficiency gap': People do not seem to adopt efficient technologies that appear financially attractive. One of the commonly cited reasons is that information about how to save energy is hard or time- consuming to collect, or that the efficient devices are hard to use. Firms that employ Big Data can help consumers overcome these challenges." - Wharton Business Economics and Public Policy Professor, Arthur van Benthem </font></h3>
